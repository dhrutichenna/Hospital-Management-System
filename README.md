# 🏥 Hospital Management System (MERN Stack)

##  Overview
This is a full-stack Hospital Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It streamlines core hospital operations such as managing patient records, doctor information, appointments, and more — all through an intuitive web interface.

The project simulates real-world hospital workflows and demonstrates my ability to build and connect frontend and backend systems securely and efficiently.

##  Core Features
- 🧾 Add, update, and delete patient details
- 👩‍⚕️ Manage doctor records and specializations
- 📅 Schedule and track appointments
- 🔐 Basic authentication and role-based access (admin/staff)
- 📊 Dashboard to view hospital statistics

##  Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Others**: Axios, React Router, Bootstrap/Material UI

##  Learning Objectives
- Built a complete full-stack web application from scratch
- Gained hands-on experience with **REST APIs** and database operations
- Learned how to implement **authentication** and manage user sessions securely
- Improved understanding of component-based architecture and routing in React

##  My Contribution
- Designed and developed the frontend UI and routing structure
- Created secure APIs for managing patients, doctors, and appointments
- Implemented login functionality with JWT-based authentication
- Managed role-based access control for different user types (admin/staff)

##  Future Enhancements
- Add password reset and email verification features
- Build a module for billing and prescription management
- Improve UI/UX with advanced filtering and chart visualizations
- Deploy the system to a cloud platform for real-time use

##  Snapshots
_Add screenshots of login page, dashboard, and patient list UI (optional but recommended)_
