#  Hospital Management System (MERN Stack)

##  Overview
This is a full-stack Hospital Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It streamlines core hospital operations such as managing patient records, doctor information, appointments, and more — all through an intuitive web interface.

The project simulates real-world hospital workflows and serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my full-stack development skills.

##  Core Features
- 🧾 Add, update, and delete patient details
- 👩‍⚕️ Manage doctor records and specializations
- 📅 Schedule and track appointments
- 🧑‍💻 Role-based access for admin/staff
- 📊 Dashboard to view hospital stats

##  Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Others**: Axios, React Router, Bootstrap/Material UI

##  Learning Objectives
- Built a fully functional full-stack web application
- Strengthened understanding of frontend-backend communication via **REST APIs**
- Implemented CRUD operations and dynamic routing
- Practiced modular code organization and state management

##  My Contribution
- Designed and developed the entire frontend user interface
- Implemented backend APIs for patient and appointment management
- Connected frontend and backend using Axios and MongoDB
- Ensured smooth data flow and basic UI responsiveness
